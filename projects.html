                    <br><br>
                    The rule of the game is to move your cursor 
                    across the maze as fast as you can without 
                    touching yellow. The faster you complete each 
                    level, the more points you will get. This game 
                    was inspired by one of the coding blocks on Scratch.

                    adventure that depends on the user to determine 
                    their fate.
