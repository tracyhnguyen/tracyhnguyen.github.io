        				<p class="projectdesc">The objective of the game is for the player to move the cursor around the map to reach the finish line. However, if the player touches anything yellow, the player loses and the game resets. There is a time that counts down from 120 seconds for every round. To score points, the player must finish each round as fast as they can. The time they finish is the number of points that will be added to their score for that round. The difficulty level increases each round as yellow objects begin to move around the screen. At the end, the user has the option of playing the bonus round. The player must choose the path with the correct answer to each question. For every correct answer, the player earns 100 points. If the wrong path is chosen, the player loses.

	        			<p>The story is about the player and a healer, named Jayden, who goes on a journey home after guarding a caravan of people. Using their gold, meal packs, and healing potions, they go on an adventure that depends on the user to determine their fate.
        				<br>
        				<br>Using Google Drawings, Aerin and I mapped out the storyline in a flowchart (shown above). The work was split in two parts: I coded everthing that happens after if the user chose to kill the wolf (kill_wolf()) while Aerin coded everything that happens after if the user tamed the wolf (tame_wolf()).</p>
