						<h1>Elevator Speech</h1>
						<p>This is my Elevator Speech! It briefly highlights my skills and experience in a quick video.
						<br>
						<br>
						"Hi my name is Tracy Nguyen and I’m an upcoming senior at La Quinta High School.
						<br>
						<br>
						As a computer science major, I program in 5 different languages: HTML, CSS, Scratch, Python, and Java. I code websites, programs, and games. Not only that, I’m a self taught graphic designer. As Public Relations Chair of Interact Club, I learned to use Google Drawings to create promotional flyers for events, meetings, and much more. I’m a dedicated volunteer as I am still a part of clubs for over ten years now. Being bilingual, I am able to apply it to my volunteer work and not only communicate but also work well with others from children to seniors. With these skills, I hope that you consider me for your company. Thank you."
