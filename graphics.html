                <h3>Dua Lipa Portrait</h3>
                <br> 2021 (3 Days)
                <br>Here is the process and  final result of digital portrait 
                I made on Photoshop of the celebrity Dua Lipa in one of her 
                music videos. The style consists of many layers of circular 
                shapes of different colors and opacity that overlay to become an image.

                <br>2022 (3 days)
                <br>
                This is a custom graphic of a friend that I drew inspired 
                character cards and banners from popular PC games. Using 
                just a mouse, keyboard, and Photoshop, I designed the card 
                to incorporate all the different details about her such as 
                her favorite band, game character, color, and even details 
                about her look such as hair color, style, jewelry, and much 
                more.

                This Christmas art was created purely with Java. It consists of
