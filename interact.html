						<h1>Public Relations Chair</h1>
						<h2>August 2019 - June 2020</h2>
						<p>As the club Public Relations Chair, I create digital flyers to promote events, fundraisers, meetings and much more. Examples can be found <a href="graphics.html" target="_blank">here</a>. In addition, I also create meeting slides for every meeting and help present along with other board members.
							<br>
							<br>I also run the club's social media accounts: Facebook Page (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/LQHSInteract" target="_blank">@LQHSInteract</a>), Facebook Group (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/lqhsinteract" target="_blank">La Quinta Interact Club</a>), Instagram (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/lqinteract" target="_blank">@lqinteract</a>) and also created the club website (<a href="https://www.sites.google.com/view/lqinteract" target="_blank">LQHS Interact Club Website</a>)
							<br>
							<br>In addition, I helped in finding service event opportunities for the club two times a month by contacting and cooperating with event coordinators outside of school. I help organize the list of members attending as well as finding transportation to those who need rides.

						<h1>Doubles Badminton Tournament</h1>
						<h2>January 2019 - March 2020</h2>
						<p>Our club hosted the school's first ever Doubles Badminton Tournament. Games were held every Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday during lunch where 9 games were held simultaneously each game day. There was a total of 86 teams (172 students). The tournament was ongoing for three months until COVID-19 cut it short at Round 4. The <a href="https://www.sites.google.com/view/lqinteract/bt/bt1920" target="_blank">'19 - '20 Badminton Tournament Webpage</a> has all the info such as game schedules, rules, and pictures of the tournament.
							<br>
							<br>Tasks I did included:
							<br>
							<ul>
								<li>Attending every game day</li>
								<li>Regularly keeping track of teams in Winners and Losers Bracket</li>
								<li>Checking-in teams and recording their scores at every game</li>
								<li>Organizing each Round and matching teams against each other by difficulty level (beginner, intermediate, expert)</li>
								<li>Communicating with teams to schedule/reschedule game days</li>
								<li>Helping referee games</li>
								<li>Creating and regularly updating the <a href="https://www.sites.google.com/view/lqinteract/bt/bt1920" target="_blank">Badminton Tournament Webpage</a></li>
							</ul>
